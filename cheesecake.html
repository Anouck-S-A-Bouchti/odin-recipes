            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and 1 cup of granulated sugar until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest (if using).</li>
            <li>Blend in sour cream until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the cheesecake filling over the prepared crust in the springform pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly.</li>
            <li>Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door closed for an additional 1 hour to prevent cracking.</li>
            <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight to set.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, carefully remove the sides of the springform pan.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve the cheesecake chilled, optionally topped with whipped cream, fresh berries, or your favorite topping.</li>
