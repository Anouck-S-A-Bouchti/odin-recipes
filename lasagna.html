            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>pinch of nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 lb lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned. Break it into smaller pieces with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook until the onion is softened and translucent.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in all-purpose flour to form a paste (roux).</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in whole milk while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Season the béchamel sauce with a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking dish with butter or cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles on top.</li>
            <li>Spoon a layer of béchamel sauce over the noodles, followed by a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers of meat sauce, noodles, béchamel sauce, and cheese until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, then serve and enjoy!</li>
